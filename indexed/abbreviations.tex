\section*{Interlinear glosses}
\label{sec:glosses}

\section*{Other abbreviations and symbols}
\label{sec:othersymbols}

\begin{table}[H]
{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.35}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ @{}l Q } 
 cs & centisecond: a~unit of time equal to 0.01 seconds\\
 F & focalization of the word that precedes (through local intonational modification of tone: see~\sectref{sec:focalization})\\
 F\textsubscript{0} & fundamental frequency (a standard abbreviation in phonetics)\\
 F1, F2{\dots} & Female language consultant number 1, 2{\dots} (this is a~standard convention in phonetics; the numbering is chronological, referring to the set of Naish recordings that have been collected since 2002)\\
 H & High tone\\
 L & Low tone\\
 M & Mid tone\\
 M1, M2{\dots} & Male language consultant number 1, 2{\dots}\\
 p.c. & personal communication\\
= & clitic boundary\\
- & affix boundary\\
. & syllable boundary\\
σ & syllable (a standard convention in phonology)\\
\ipa{|} & tone group boundary (see Chapter~\ref{chap:toneassignmentrulesandthedivisionoftheutteranceintotonegroups})\\
\ipa{{$\sim$}} & reduplication (example: /\ipa{wɤ˩{$\sim$}wɤ˩˥}/)\\
\ipa{≈} & free variation: variation that is not conditioned by phonological or morphosyntactic parameters (example: [\ipa{tɕɥe}]{\kern2pt}\ipa{≈}{\kern2pt}[\ipa{tɕɥi}]). In this volume, the tilde {$\sim$}, commonly used in linguistics as a~symbol for free variation, is reserved for reduplication.\\
\ipa{↑} & emphatic stress on syllable that follows (see~\sectref{sec:emphaticstressanditstoneddownavatars})\\ 
\# & word boundary (see Chapter~\ref{chap:thelexicaltonesofnouns}); by extension: the boundary of the entire expression to which a~tone pattern is associated (see Chapters~\ref{chap:compoundnouns}-\ref{chap:verbsandtheircombinatoryproperties})\\
\$ & a symbol used in H\$, one of the lexical categories of H tones\\
\end{tabularx}}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]
{\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.35}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ @{}l Q } 
-- & morpheme break, used in the representation of the tone pattern of an expression made up of two (or more) morphemes. Thus, for a dimorphemic compound noun, --L refers to a~L tone that attaches after the morpheme break (i.e.\ on the second noun: the head noun), and LM--L indicates that the first noun gets LM tone and the second gets L. (In earlier publications on Yongning Na, the symbol used was a~superscript circle~$^{\circ}$, but this use of the symbol conflicted headlong with Africanist usage, in which L$^{\circ}$ refers to a~\textit{level} L tone: a~tone that contrasts with L through the absence of a~phonetic falling contour.)\\
//\ipa{ʐwæ˥}// & underlying phonological form (a~vertical bar is more usual, but in this volume the vertical bar is used for tone group boundaries)\\
/\ipa{ʐwæ˧}/ & surface-phonological form\\
{[\ipa{ʐwæ˧}]} & phonetic realization\\
*\ipa{ʐwæ˧} & a reconstructed form\\
†\ipa{ʐwæ˧} & a form that is predicted on the basis of regular rules, but unattested\\
$\ddagger${\kern2pt}\ipa{ʐwæ˧} & incorrect (ungrammatical) form; note that the asterisk is not used, to preclude confusion with reconstructed forms\\
:: & phonological correspondence between two languages or dialects (a~standard convention in historical linguistics)\\
\end{tabularx}}
\end{table}

\section*{References to online annotated recordings of Yongning Na}
\label{sec:refstotxts}

One"=click links from the electronic version of this book to the examples cited are not yet available, unfortunately. Interested readers need to locate the document in the list of Yongning Na recordings in the archive, open it, and navigate down to the cited sentence. Examples from the online texts are referred to in the following
format: text identifier followed by a dot followed by the sentence
number. For instance, Sister.27 refers to sentence 27 in the
narrative referred to for short as ‘Sister'. For some of the stories, several versions were recorded. In these cases, the version number is indicated after the text identifier, without a separator: thus, Dog2.35 refers to sentence 35 in the second version of the narrative ‘Dog'.

Here is a list of texts, providing the correspondences between
identifiers and full titles.
